# Extraction Safety Protocol

## Eligibility Criteria for Extraction

### ✅ EXTRACTION ELIGIBLE:
- **Whiteheads (Closed Comedones)**: Small, white, surface-level bumps
- **Blackheads (Open Comedones)**: Dark, open pores with visible sebum
- **Superficial Pustules**: Small, pus-filled lesions with visible head
- **Milia**: Small, white, keratin-filled cysts (surface level only)

### ❌ EXTRACTION NOT ELIGIBLE:
- **Deep Nodules**: No visible head, extends into dermis
- **Cystic Acne**: Large, deep, painful lesions
- **Inflamed Lesions**: Red, swollen, tender to touch
- **Active Infection**: Signs of spreading, warmth, or systemic symptoms
- **Recent Trauma**: Broken skin, scabs, or open wounds
- **Unclear Lesions**: Cannot definitively identify lesion type

## Safety Guidelines:

### Pre-Extraction Assessment:
1. **Visual Inspection**: Confirm lesion type and depth
2. **Tactile Assessment**: Check for firmness and depth
3. **Inflammation Check**: Assess redness and swelling
4. **Skin Integrity**: Ensure no broken skin or wounds nearby

### Extraction Techniques (Reference Only):
- Sterile environment required
- Proper sanitization of tools and skin
- Gentle pressure application
- Stop if excessive force required
- Post-extraction care instructions

### Risk Factors:
- **High Risk**: Deep lesions, active inflammation, compromised skin barrier
- **Medium Risk**: Moderate inflammation, unclear lesion type
- **Low Risk**: Surface-level, clearly defined, non-inflamed lesions

## Triage Levels:

**Routine**: 
- Mild acne (GAGS 0-18)
- Surface-level lesions
- Non-inflamed
- Clear extraction eligibility

**Monitor**:
- Moderate acne (GAGS 19-30)
- Some inflammation present
- Mixed lesion types
- Requires professional assessment

**Referral**:
- Severe/Very Severe (GAGS 31-44)
- Deep nodules or cysts
- Significant inflammation
- Signs of infection
- Unclear diagnosis
